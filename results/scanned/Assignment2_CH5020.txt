Question 1

If a hypothesis is rejected at a particular significance level, can it be accepted
at a higher level of significance? When increasing the level of significance, is
the confidence interval becoming broader or narrower?

No, a hypothesis cannot be accepted at a higher level of significance if it is rejected
at a specific significance level. This is because increasing the significance threshold (a)
makes it easier to reject the null hypothesis rather than accept it.

Additionally, when the level of significance is increased, the corresponding confidence
interval becomes narrower. A higher a results in a lower confidence level (1 â€” a), leading
to a tighter interval around the estimate.

Question 2

Find the degrees of freedom (dof) in T-distribution such that P(Z > 2.086404) =
P(Taop > 2.5). Why is the value corresponding to the T-distribution higher
than the Z value? [5]
Given:
P(Z > 2.086404) = P(Tiot > 2.5)

From the standard Z table,
P(Z > 2.086404) = 0.01847
We need to find the degrees of freedom (dof) for the T-distribution such that:
P(Taog > 2.5) = 0.01847
